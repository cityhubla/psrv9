<p>This map provides but a snapshot of the complex story of industry in South-Central Los Angeles. How has industry in Los Angeles changed over time? What is the connection between industry and health? How can policy be leveraged to protect communities from harmful industries while supporting equitable, sustainable development?  Check out our resources below to explore this story through various lenses.</p>
<br>
<h2>Health</h2>
<p><a href='http://healthyplan.la/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Health-Atlas-for-the-City-of-Los-Angeles-July-2013-FINAL-SMALL.pdf' target="_blank">Health Atlas for the City of Los Angeles</a> - From environmental conditions to land use analysis to the “hardship index”, the Health Atlas provides valuable insight into the relationship between health and the built environment. The Health Atlas also reveals jarring health disparities within Los Angeles County, with South Los Angeles demonstrating higher rates of mortality, diabetes, asthma, and other chronic conditions. Explore the Health Atlas to find out more about what health looks like in different parts of Los Angeles.</p>
<br>
<p><a href='https://dornsife.usc.edu/pere/cumulative-impacts/' target="_blank">Environmental Justice Screening Method</a> - How does one assess the cumulative impact of an array of environmental hazards? Is there a way to holistically assess health disparities in low income communities of color and other vulnerable communities? The Environmental Justice Screening Method seeks to answer these questions, framing these disparities through the lens of environmental justice.</p>
<br>
<p><a href='http://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-version-20' target="_blank">CalEnviroScreen 2.0</a> - Another excellent resource which was a huge inspiration for the 500 Feet Project. CalEnviroScreen is a tool created to visualize the burden of pollution on different communities in California. It combines environmental, health, and socioeconomic data to generate a “score” which attempts to capture the cumulative impact of environmental conditions in every census tract in the state. According to CalEnvrioScreen, South Los Angeles is in the top 5-10% most environmentally burdened areas in all of California.</p>
<br>
<h2>Policy</h2>
<p><a href='https://cleanupgreenup.wordpress.com/' target="_blank">Clean Up Green Up</a> - Three neighborhoods in Los Angeles &#8212 Boyle Heights, Pacoima, and Wilmington &#8212 are the sites for an innovative policy which seeks to reduce pollution, prevent future pollution, and jumpstart sustainable and equitable development in communities long considered “toxic hotspots”. The 500 Feet Project seeks to build off of the momentum of CUGU and expand the reach of this policy to South Los Angeles.</p>
<br>
<p><a href='https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/hidden-hazards-low-res-version.pdf' target="_blank">Hidden Hazards Report</a> - Emerging out of a powerful partnership between the LA Collaborative for Environmental Health & Justice and the Liberty Hill Foundation, this report has informed not only the 500 Feet Project’s own research methodology, but also helped inspire the Clean Up Green Up Ordinance. Read this report to get an insight into the research and methodology behind community-based research and policy development.</p> 
<br>
<p><a href='https://www.arb.ca.gov/ch/handbook.pdf' target="_blank">Air Quality and Land Use Handbook</a> – As part of their continued effort to reduce air pollution across the state, the California Air and Resources Board developed a handbook to provide information about how certain land uses affect air quality and health, as well as recommendations on how to best plan communities in order to reduce negative health impacts. More specifically, it suggests the minimum distance that sensitive uses should be sited from certain hazardous uses, including a 500-foot buffer that became the foundation of this project.</p>
