<h2>So I’ll jump right in and ask the question on everyone’s mind: why only 500 Feet?</h2>
 
<p>Excellent question! The 500 Feet buffer is a number that we spent extensive time deliberating over. The California Air Resources Board’s <a href='https://www.arb.ca.gov/ch/handbook.pdf' target="_blank">Air Quality and Land Use Handbook</a> states that “sensitive land uses be sited no closer than 500 feet from a freeway or major roadway, a buffer area that was developed to protect sensitive receptors from exposure to diesel [particulate matter].” Research shows that there is a 70% decrease in particulate matter after 500 feet, a decrease that greatly affects air quality and health outcomes. Building off of this data, we decided to set 500 feet as a buffer to visualize the minimum impact of incompatible land uses on surrounding communities. Though this buffer does not by any means capture all potential impacts of industrial hazards, it allows us to visualize the most egregious and pressing incompatibilities.</p>

<h2>How did we decide what counts as a sensitive use?</h2>
 
<p>Our project is part of a greater conversation on industry and health in South Central Los Angeles. We draw from the following definition from the California Air Resources Board’s <a href='https://www.arb.ca.gov/ch/handbook.pdf' target="_blank">Air Quality and Land Use Handbook</a>:</p>
 
<p>“Sensitive individuals refer to those segments of the population most susceptible to poor air quality (i.e., children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing serious health problems affected by air quality). Land uses where sensitive individuals are most likely to spend time include schools and schoolyards, parks and playgrounds, daycare centers, nursing homes, hospitals, and residential communities (sensitive sites or sensitive land uses).” (2)</p>
 
<p>Liberty Hill’s <a href='https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/hidden-hazards-low-res-version.pdf' target="_blank">Hidden Hazards Report</a> builds upon this definition to include community knowledge of places where vulnerable populations spend great amounts of time, adding informal home-based daycare sites, churches, senior centers to the list of sensitive uses. We combined the above two definitions to create a list which captures both the official definition of “sensitive use” as well as sensitive uses as articulated by community members.</p>
 
And of course, as we integrate more community voices and concerns, our project will reshap and adapte to include these perspectives.</p>

<h2>So what’s considered a hazardous use?</h2>
 
<p>A hazardous use is essentially a source of air pollution. CARB’s Air Quality and Land Use Handbook specifically includes uses such as “freeways, distribution centers, rail yards, ports, refineries, chrome plating facilities, dry cleaners, and gasoline dispensing facilities,” and have placed focus on these uses due to their emission of “toxic air contaminants,” especially diesel particulate matter. The CUGU ordinance, on which our project is based, also provided guidance on what constitutes a hazardous use. The toxic emissions produced by these industrial uses cause major health risks to the sensitive populations nearby, and can contribute to higher incidences of asthma, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer.</p>
 
<p>Just like the list of sensitive uses, the list of hazardous uses is not exhaustive. But, for the purpose of our project, we chose to focus on the industrial uses that cause the most harm in the South and Southeast LA communities and as defined by existing standards and guidelines.<p>
