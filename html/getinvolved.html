<h1>Get Involved</h1>

<p>Are you a South LA Resident? A community advocate? An inquisitive student? There are opportunities for everyone to get involved. Here are 5 ways you can be a part of our project:</p>
 
<h3>1.   Create a ground-truthing team.</h3>
<p>The 500 Feet Project is a large scale effort to map and validate incompatible land uses in South LA. A project of this scale needs your help! Whether you are a local nonprofit, a network of community members, or a group of students working on a class project, we can work together to add your voice to the map. Together, we’ll determine the geographic area you will be ground-truthing, conduct trainings on what to look for on the ground, and brainstorm ways to add your concerns and insights to the map.</p>
 
<h3>2. Share your story.</h3>
<p>Does your child walk by a highly polluting oil drilling site on his or her way to school? Does your asthma act up every time you go for a jog down the high traffic road nearby? Our map can only say so much about incompatible land uses. Your stories speak volumes about the real-life impacts of industry on health, well-being, and safety in a community. We need your story in order to give a face and a voice to those within 500 Feet.</p>
 
<h3>3. Provide feedback.</h3>
<p>The 500 Feet Project always has room to grow and improve. We want to hear your thoughts on what worked and what didn’t work. What did you find confusing? What did you find particularly compelling? Send us an email with your thoughts on the current version of our map and let us know if there’s anything we can improve!</p>
 
<h3>4. Spread the word.</h3>
<p>We want to get as many folks involved in this effort as possible. Share the 500 Feet Project with your networks and spread the word. We hope that this project becomes a tool that health advocates, community residents, and educational institutions can learn from and contribute to. But we need your voice and your networks to make that happen.</p>
 
<h3>5. Imagine the future.</h3>
<p>Our vision is to create a healthy, sustainable, and equitable South LA. What’s yours? Tell us how you imagine the future of industry in South LA.</p>
